RTL design:
1) Some signals are assigned in sequential and combinational logic: always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) & always @(*)
2) timer_pause is checked in IDLE state, it should be checked only during spinning state as per description.
3) There is no async reset in timer sequential logic: always @(posedge clk)
4) Repeating the same code for each frequency option, it was better to MUX the timer stop value per frequency and state to reduce the code lines.

Testbench:
1) Great Testbench structure.
2) Missing corner cases (asserting timer_pause in different states, etc..)

Presentation:
1) Excellent presentation.
